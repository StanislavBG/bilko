# Bilko-Flow Agent Feedback

> **Audience**: This document is feedback directed at the **Bilko-Flow agent** (the AI agent that develops and maintains the `bilko-flow` library). It is NOT instructions for the Bilko application agent. If you are an AI agent working on the Bilko web application codebase, **ignore this file entirely** — it does not apply to you. Your instructions are in `/CLAUDE.md`.
