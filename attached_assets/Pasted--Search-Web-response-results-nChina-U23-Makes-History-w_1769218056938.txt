This remarkable achievement comes after a series of strong performances, culminating in a decisive 3-0 victory over Vietnam in the semifinals. The Chinese squad is now set to face continental powerhouse Japan in the championship match.\n\nPreviously, China U23 had never advanced beyond the group stage in their five prior appearances in the biennial tournament between 2014 and 2024. Their historic run to the semifinals, achieved by defeating Uzbekistan 4-2 in a penalty shootout after a goalless draw in the quarterfinals, was already a significant milestone, drawing considerable attention.\n\nThe unexpected success has been met with fervent reactions, particularly within China. Media outlets have lauded the team's "historic final berth" and expressed soaring confidence in Chinese soccer. The Gongyin Daily praised China for making history with its first "best eight and best four" finishes, noting that the convincing 3-0 win against Vietnam in the semifinal erased earlier doubts about their defensive-oriented, counter-attacking style and limited goal-scoring in the group stage. This semifinal victory saw China not only score three goals, equaling their total from the 2022 tournament through the 2026 quarterfinals, but also extend their clean-sheet streak to five matches.\n\nChinese fans, who have endured years of underachieving men's football, are reportedly "in a frenzy" over the youth squad's performance. The team's collective spirit, focus, and tactical discipline under Spanish coach Antonio Puche have been highlighted as key factors. Goalkeeper Li Hao has been particularly praised for his solid performance, including keeping a clean sheet against Uzbekistan despite facing numerous shots. Center-back Liu Haofan attributed the semifinal victory to the team's mentality, stating that they treated every opponent as strong, while suggesting Vietnam may have underestimated them.\n\nConversely, the defeat was a bitter blow for Vietnam, which had entered the semifinals with an impressive winning streak. Vietnamese coach Kim Sang-sik apologized to fans, acknowledging China's excellent play and high concentration. Despite the loss, Vietnamese fans have largely been supportive of their coach, recognizing the team's journey to the semifinals as a significant achievement.\n\nThe upcoming final against defending champions Japan marks a significant moment for Chinese football, with players expressing confidence in challenging for the title. This historic run is seen as a major boost for the sport in China and a testament to the focus on cultivating domestic youth talents.\n## References:\n- vnexpress.net\n- chosun.com\n- chinadailyhk.com\n- people.cn\n- vietnam.vn\n- vietnamnews.vn\n- vnexpress.net\n- reddit.com\n- chosun.com\n- youtube.com\n- chosun.com\n"}}
