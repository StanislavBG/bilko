To self-host n8n on Replit in 2026, you need to move beyond a simple "one-click" setup to ensure your data is persistent and your webhooks are reliable. Replit’s ephemeral file system means that without specific configurations, your workflows and credentials will disappear every time the Repl restarts.

1. Essential n8n Environment Variables
Inside your Repl, go to the Secrets (Environment Variables) tab and configure the following:

N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY: Critical. Set a long, random string. If this changes or is lost, you will not be able to open your saved credentials.

WEBHOOK_URL: Set this to your Repl's public URL (e.g., https://your-repl-name.your-username.repl.co/). Without this, n8n will generate local URLs that external services (like Stripe or GitHub) cannot reach.

N8N_PORT: Set to 5678 (the default, but good to explicitly define for Replit's networking).

N8N_PATH: Usually /.

TZ: Set your timezone (e.g., America/New_York) to ensure scheduled workflows run at the correct time.

2. Solving the "Data Loss" Problem (Database)
By default, n8n uses SQLite, which stores data in a local file. On Replit, this file is deleted when the container sleeps or updates.

The Best Practice: Do not use the internal SQLite. Instead, connect to an external PostgreSQL database (e.g., using Supabase, Neon, or Railway).

Configuration needed:

DB_TYPE: postgresdb

DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST: Your database host

DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT: 5432

DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE: Your DB name

DB_POSTGRESDB_USER: Your DB username

DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD: Your DB password

3. Deployment Configuration (Replit Specific)
To keep n8n running 24/7 (essential for webhooks and triggers):

Reserved VM: Use a Reserved VM deployment rather than "Autoscale." n8n needs to be "always on" to listen for incoming webhooks.

Memory: Ensure you allocate at least 2GB of RAM. n8n can be memory-intensive when processing large JSON objects or many concurrent workflows.

replit.nix: Ensure you have nodejs-18_x (or higher) and python3 (for some n8n nodes) in your nix configuration.

4. Security
N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE: Set to true.

N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER & N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD: Set these to prevent anyone who finds your URL from accessing your workflows.

Alternatively, use n8n's built-in User Management (v1.0+) which will prompt you to create an owner account on the first launch.

5. Performance Tweaks for Replit
If your workflows are crashing due to memory limits:

N8N_EXECUTIONS_PROCESS: Set to main. This runs executions inside the main process, saving the overhead of spawning new child processes for every single run (highly recommended for resource-constrained environments like Replit).

EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_SUCCESS: Set to none (if you don't need to see the history of successful runs) to keep the database size small.

Summary Checklist:

[ ] Link an external PostgreSQL DB.

[ ] Set a permanent N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY.

[ ] Use a Reserved VM to avoid "Sleeping Repl" issues.

[ ] Set WEBHOOK_URL so your triggers actually work.
