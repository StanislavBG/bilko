Phase 1: The "Muscle" (n8n Setup)
You must set up n8n first so Replit has something to talk to. Replit Agent cannot "click" inside your n8n dashboard for you, so you must expose a Webhook.

Open n8n (Cloud or Self-hosted).

Create a new Workflow:

Trigger: Add a Webhook node.

Method: Set to POST.

Path: Set to agent-chat.

Authentication: Set to None (for now) or Header Auth (for security).

Logic: Add your AI Agent node (e.g., AI Agent or OpenAI) connected to the Webhook.

Response: Add a Respond to Webhook node at the end.

Deploy: Click "Execute Workflow" or "Active" to make the URL live.

Copy the Production URL: It usually looks like https://[your-n8n-instance]/webhook/agent-chat.

Phase 2: The "Face" (Replit Agent)
Now you use "Vibe Coding" to have Replit build the entire full-stack application that connects to that webhook.

Open Replit, click "New Repl", select "Agent", and use the following Prompt Strategy.

The Golden "Vibe" Prompt
Copy and paste this prompt into Replit Agent. Replace [YOUR_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL] with the link you copied in Phase 1.

Build a modern AI Chat Agent application.

Stack:

Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS. Clean, dark-mode UI.

Backend: Node.js (Express).

Logic: The backend must act as a proxy. When the user sends a message in the UI, the backend should send a POST request to my external n8n webhook.

Specific Requirements:

API Proxy: Create an endpoint /api/chat. This receives the user's message, forwards it to [YOUR_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL], and returns the n8n response to the frontend.

Streaming: If possible, handle text streaming so the UI looks alive.

UI: A center-aligned chat interface (like ChatGPT). Include a sidebar for "Chat History" (store history in a simple generic database or local storage for now).

Error Handling: If n8n is down, show a friendly error message in the chat bubble.

Environment: Use a .env file to store the N8N_WEBHOOK_URL so I can change it later easily.

Phase 3: "Managing" n8n from Replit (Advanced Vibe Coding)
You asked for Replit to "manage the needed in n8n".

The Easy Way: You manually edit n8n workflows, and Replit just triggers them.

The "Agentic" Way (Harder): You want to type into Replit "Create a workflow that sends an email" and have it actually build the n8n workflow.

To do this, you must give Replit Agent access to the n8n Public API.

Get n8n API Key: Go to n8n Settings > API > Create API Key.

Update Replit Prompt: Add this to your prompt:

Admin Dashboard Feature: Create a "/admin" page in the UI. This page should list my current active n8n workflows.

Use the n8n Public API (GET /workflows).

I will provide the N8N_API_KEY in the secrets.

Allow me to "Activate/Deactivate" workflows directly from this Replit UI by sending PUT requests to the n8n API.

Why this works best
No CORS Errors: By asking Replit to build a "Backend Proxy" (Node/Express), you avoid the common error where the browser blocks requests to n8n.

Security: Your n8n API keys and Webhook URLs stay hidden in the Replit server (.env), not exposed to the public user.

Separation of Concerns: Replit handles the "Vibe" (Look and feel), while n8n handles the heavy lifting (integrations with Google, Slack, etc.).
